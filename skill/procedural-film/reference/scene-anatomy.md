# Scene anatomy

How a well-formed scene file is built.
Expect 1000+ lines for a dense shot — density is part of the look (hundreds of hatch strokes, lattice cells, grain per frame).

## Skeleton

1. **Header comment**: shot number, title, global T range, the layer list numbered back to front.
2. **IIFE + `'use strict'`**; `const ID = '<shot-id>'`; aliases (`const L = info.lib` / `LIB = FILM.lib`, `P = pal`, `E = ease`, `TAU`, `DEG`, `FR = 1/24`); local `clamp/lerp/sstep`.
3. **The seed factory** — every seed in the file derives from the shot id:

   ```js
   const sd = (...k) => LIB.hash(ID, ...k) & 0x7fffffff;
   ```

4. **Geometry data tables** — hand-authored point arrays. Shapes that survive a match cut copy the storyboard's Shared geometry numbers exactly, and seed from the earlier shot's id (`const REF = 'egg-blueprint'; L.hash(REF, …)`) so the boil matches across the cut.
5. **Memoized geometry**: `function geo(L) { if (GEO) return GEO; … }` — module-level, built once, seeded, and strictly t-independent. Sprite canvases go through `L.cached(key, …)`.
6. **Local draw helpers**: `stroke(ctx, path, color, alpha, width, dash?)`, `wob(L, path, pts, seed, amp, bi, closed)` (per-boil polyline wobble via `h3(i, bi, seed)`), stroke bucketing by alpha to batch fills.
7. **Timing helpers** (nearly verbatim in every scene):

   ```js
   const drawing = (a) => Math.floor((t - a) * 12 + 1e-6);            // drawings since beat a
   const hit = (a, frames, e, lead = 1) =>
     t < a ? 0 : (e || ((u) => u))(clamp((t - a) / (frames * FR) + lead / frames)); // visible ON the beat frame
   const popTwos = (a) => (t < a ? 0 : [0.72, 1.08, 1][Math.min(2, drawing(a))]);   // 3-drawing pop with overshoot
   ```

   plus named beat constants with global-T comments: `const B_DIV2 = 1.5; // T 3.0`.
8. **`FILM.scene({ id: ID, draw(ctx, tIn, info) {…} })` at the very end.**

## Draw body discipline

- Clamp first: `t = clamp(tIn, 0, info.dur)` — a transition asks the outgoing shot for `t` slightly beyond its duration; hold the final pose.
- Frame 0 is a fully drawn pose and the last frame holds — the gate draws first/middle/last of every shot.
- `tw = L.onTwos(t)` for anything drawn as a character or object; `bi = L.boil(info.T)` drives line wobble.
- Draw layers back to front under numbered comments; annotation overlays last, screen-fixed (no camera transform).
- Beat events use `lead` so the event is visible on its beat frame, not one frame late.
- `info.p` for whole-shot ramps; `info.T` (or `info.shot.start + t`) for cross-shot continuity like stripe drift and boil.
- Caches only for t-independent data. Anything time-varying derives from `t` alone.

## Text

Almost none — `lib.text` appears once per film (the closing wordmark). Labels ride on `bracket({ label })`, `arcAnnotation({ label })` and `ticks`. Schematic shots carry no text at all (art bible §5).

## What the gate catches — the expensive mistakes

- `Math.random`, `Date`, `performance.now`, `crypto` in any drawing or audio source (static scan).
- Draw-order dependence or unseeded randomness: the determinism pass renders every checked frame five ways — warm forward, warm reversed, fresh page shuffled with decoy frames, cold first-draw after reload, and sequential (f−1 then f) — and compares full pixel hashes.
- Any throw on a checked frame, including errors thrown by the *outgoing* shot inside a transition.
- Timeline ids a scene file fails to register, duplicate registrations, a `transitionIn.dur` longer than its shot.
- Frames over 150 ms (warning; `--budget ms` makes it a failure).

Two more traps the gate does not need to catch because core handles them, and you should still avoid: writing to `FILM.lib`, `pal` or `ease` (they are frozen — the write throws), and leaving `ctx.save()` unbalanced (core unwinds it, at a cost).

## Canvas and continuity traps

The gate does not catch these; critics do, one wave late. Avoid them instead:

- `ctx.clip()` applies at stroke/fill time, never while recording a `Path2D`. When batching geometry into a path, clip where you stroke, not where you build: `ctx.save(); ctx.clip(shapePath); ctx.stroke(lines); ctx.restore()`.
- Match-cut shapes and cross-shot handoffs (the storyboard's G-tables, stream positions a sibling shot continues) are drawn **screen-fixed**: they never ride `lib.camera`. Exempt them from the transform or compensate it so the outgoing frame lands exactly on the contract pixels — then snap both sides of the cut and compare.
- Elements that attach or detach around a match cut (a prop, a saucer) fade in/out over 5–6 frames, symmetric on both sides. A one-frame vanish reads as a bug.
- Recurring cross-shot elements (the progress glyph) drift when re-derived per scene. Copy the canonical helper verbatim from the owning scene named in your brief; never re-implement it.

## Workflow

Read the storyboard entry, the art bible and the shared geometry → write the file →
`node tools/snap.cjs --shot <id> --only --samples 6 --sheet` → open the contact sheet and look at every frame → fix → re-snap. When the sheet is on-brief, run the full gate.
