name: hand-drawn-canvas-animation
description: Make a short film that looks hand-drawn or hand-printed, where every frame is drawn by JavaScript on Canvas 2D from one HTML file on top of a shared core, then rendered to mp4 with a generated Web Audio score. Four looks from one core and one palette system - ink on warm paper with hatching, riso halftone prints in fluorescent inks, flat screen prints with dot grids, and graphite minimalism with torn sections - drawn on twos (12 fps), with blueprint interludes, ink blots, ripples, montages, badge galleries and a hand-lettered sign-off. Use when the user asks for an animation, animated explainer, "мультик", "рисованный ролик", "нарисуй анимацию кодом", a riso or screen-print look, "every frame drawn in JavaScript", a procedural or generative short film, or a canvas video in this family of styles for any subject. Not for UI animation, charts or Remotion slide decks.

# Hand-drawn canvas animation

You are drawing every frame of a 10 to 30 second film in JavaScript. One HTML
file that loads `core.js`, vanilla Canvas 2D, no images, no libraries, no
video model. A headless Chrome screenshots the frames, ffmpeg packs them, and
the same file writes the music from the same timeline.

Look first: `assets/preview-four-looks.jpg` (one subject through the four
looks), `assets/preview-fly-style.jpg` (a 9.5 s ink film),
`assets/preview-template.jpg` (the template's style sheet, palette sheet and
two demo scenes).

## Files

| path | use it for |
|---|---|
| `assets/core.js` | the core: palettes and colour maths, four finishes, marks, lattices, motifs, reveals, camera, timeline, score plumbing, player, render hooks. Copy next to every film. Never edit per film. |
| `assets/film-template.html` | the file you copy and edit: brief, palette, a puppet, two demo scenes, score, `defineFilm`. |
| `examples/four-looks.html` | a paper boat through riso, screen, pencil and ink with the devices of each look. Read it when a recipe from N to Z is unclear. |
| `examples/fly-style.html` | a 9.5 s ink film: peach, ink blot, dividing egg, camera-follow flight, compound-eye mosaic. Read it for recipes A to H. |
| `scripts/render.mjs`, `scripts/package.json` | headless render from the page's own canvas: `--grid` sheet in seconds, `--only` spot frames, `--ar` and `--width` for format and resolution, full mp4 on twos with a contact sheet. |
| `references/style.md` | the four looks, the 14 rules, the vocabulary table (term → look → kit call). Read before drawing anything. |
| `references/palettes.md` | the palette schema, presets, deriving, tints and shades, finishes and plates. Read before picking colours. |
| `references/scenes.md` | 26 scene recipes across the four looks, timing rules, score motifs. Read while writing the beat sheet. |
| `references/architecture.md` | file layout, invariants, the API index, puppets, riso plates, budget, rendering, pitfalls. Read before editing code. |
| `references/brief-template.md` | the brief to fill from the user's request. |
| `references/reference-films.md` | measurements and shot lists of the four films the looks come from. |

## Procedure

Do the steps in order. You cannot judge a frame from code; every "look" means
open the PNG and look at it.

1. **Brief.** Fill `references/brief-template.md` from the request. Ask at
   most one round of questions (subject, length, format, look). Invent the rest.
   Decide the anchor: the one element that survives every cut.
2. **Project folder.** One folder per film:
   ```bash
   mkdir <film> && cp <skill>/assets/core.js <skill>/assets/film-template.html <film>/
   mv <film>/film-template.html <film>/<film>.html
   cp <skill>/scripts/render.mjs <skill>/scripts/package.json <film>/ && cd <film> && npm i --no-audit --no-fund
   ```
   `puppeteer-core` drives the system Chrome and downloads nothing. ffmpeg
   must be on PATH. Set `CHROME=/path/to/chrome` if it is not found.
3. **Beat sheet.** A table in the comment above the timeline: start,
   duration, scene, look, camera, what changes, kit calls, sound cue. Pick
   recipes from `references/scenes.md`.
4. **Palette and sheets.** `usePalette(...)` per `references/palettes.md`.
   Keep `styleSheet` and `paletteSheet` as the first two timeline entries
   while you work. Render and look:
   ```bash
   node render.mjs <film>.html --only 0,12 --ar 1:1
   ```
   `--ar 16:9` or `--ar 9:16` for other formats; `--width 1920` for a larger
   output. Scenes place things relative to `CX`, `CY`, `W`, `H`, never at
   literal pixels, so the format is a render-time choice.
5. **Puppets.** Build each character or object in the PUPPET section per
   `references/architecture.md`. Put it on the style sheet at scales 0.6, 1
   and 1.8. It must read at 240 px.
6. **Scenes, one at a time.** Implement, register in the timeline, then
   ```bash
   node render.mjs <film>.html --grid 24
   ```
   and look at `out/<film>-grid.jpg`: 24 evenly spaced frames of the whole
   film in a few seconds. Fix what does not read, then the next scene. Use
   `--only` for a single frame at full size. Drawn frame index = seconds × 12.
7. **Full render and review.** `node render.mjs <film>.html`, open
   `out/<film>-contact.jpg`, run the checklist below, fix, repeat until clean.
   Remove the sheet entries from the timeline for the final render.
8. **Score.** Edit `score` against the beat sheet. Export the WAV from the
   page (`export score.wav`, needs a click in a real browser) or ask the user
   to, then mux:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i out/<film>.mp4 -i score.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest out/<film>-final.mp4
   ```
9. **Deliver** `<film>.html` with `core.js`, the mp4, the contact sheet, and
   one line per scene saying what it shows.

## Two Working Modes

1. **Single-File Mode (Rapid Prototype / Short Form):**
   - Single HTML file (`assets/film-template.html`) loading `core.js`.
   - Rendered with `scripts/render.mjs`.
   - Best for fast turnaround (15–60 s explainers, quick social formats).

2. **Modular Pipeline Mode (Production / Multi-Shot):**
   - Modular project structure powered by the sibling `procedural-film` skill (`skill/procedural-film`).
   - Each shot is an isolated file (`src/scenes/NN-<id>.js`) registered into `src/timeline.js`.
   - Engine split into `src/core.js` and `src/lib.js` with camera transitions and boiling grain.
   - Strict 6-check verification gate (`node tools/check.cjs`).
   - Playwright-based contact sheets (`tools/snap.cjs`) and bundler (`tools/build.cjs` -> `dist/<slug>.html`).


## Non-negotiable rules

Full text and reasons in `references/style.md`.

1. `paper(c)` or `night(c)` first. Never pure black or white.
2. Texture is a finish (`surface`), never a gradient, filter or blur on the
   final canvas. Gradients live only inside riso plates.
3. Fill and outline never coincide: `Path2D` fill, jittered `wob` or
   `crayon` outline.
4. Misregistration is an accent: `scribble` on at most two parts, two-ink
   offsets on dots and lettering only.
5. Every drawable takes `mode`; blueprint is the same geometry in chalk.
6. `Math.random` is banned. Everything goes through `rng(seed)`.
7. Draw at 12 fps, output 24. `drawFrame(i)` is pure.
8. Hard cuts. One transition device between two shots. One finish per shot.
9. Every colour comes from `PAL`; palettes change only on cuts.
10. Silhouettes read at 240 px; montage cards at 120 px.
11. One anchor survives every cut.
12. End with `signOff`.

## Review checklist

Each item found on the contact sheet or in a spot frame is a defect:

- blank or near-blank frame that is not a deliberate flash;
- subject that does not read at 240 px, or cut by the frame edge without intent;
- a surface without its finish (reads as clipart) or two finishes in one shot;
- a colour not in `PAL`, or a palette change inside a shot;
- texture boil between consecutive drawn frames of a static shot;
- a transition longer than 1 s, or two transition devices in a row;
- more than two scribbled parts in one frame;
- a riso card with no paper showing, or a subject tinted by every plate;
- text in the frame outside the style sheet and the sign-off;
- the anchor missing from a shot;
- a literal pixel position in a scene instead of `CX`, `CY`, `W`, `H`;
- a cue time not on the 1/12 s grid;
- page errors printed by `render.mjs`.

## Adapting to other subjects

The core is subject-agnostic. A GPU, a server, a token, a city or a recipe
is built the same way as the fly or the boat: parts as paths, a pose object
with 3 to 6 numbers, a normal and a blueprint renderer. Hex lattices become
LEDs, cells or tiles; stripes become vents or traces; `construction` lines
make any object read as a technical drawing; a riso card of it is three
plates with knockouts. See "Non-creature subjects" in
`references/architecture.md` and the palette advice in
`references/palettes.md`.

If the project already renders video with Remotion, call `drawFrame` from a
component on a canvas ref: `fps: 24` and `drawFrame(Math.floor(frame / 2))`
inside `useCurrentFrame()`.
